I kept expecting to hear Bonnie's first bark as squirrels ran along the top of the fence in the backyard during out regular trips out there. But it happened inside the house today after Andy returned from a long run. She was sitting with me in the guest room/office when he unlocked the door and came in. She barked, then growled, then barked some more. It took her a few seconds to recognize him and stop. Later that day she barked again at the mail lady. I've been googling how to get her to stop on command and have some ideas. It's going to be challenging getting regular opportunities to practice with this pandemic.

Here's Bonnie in my office listening by the window for any threats.
