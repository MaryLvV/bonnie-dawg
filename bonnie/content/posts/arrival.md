We visited the [Nashville Humane Association](https://nashvillehumane.org/) on the Sunday before Thanksgiving by appointment. By appointment, because of the Covid-19 Pandemic. We spent some time with Bonnie. She was so scared whe had to be carried to the room where we hung out with her. When she got there she tried to hide under a chair.  

We decided to take her home and had our exit meeting with the vet. That's when we found out she had heartworms. We went home to think about whether we were ready to make that commitment, and returned on Tuesday morning to bring her home.  

Andy and I prepped the kitchen with gates, a crate and pad, food and water bowls, and a couple of toys. Bonnie wanted nothing to do with any of it. She spent the rest of Tuesday cowering by a gate. She wouldn't relieve herself when we took her outside. It was a long day, and we left her by that gate when we went to bed Tuesday night wondering what we were in for.  

The next morning, she was lying in the crate! She spent most of the day in the crate, and within a few days was relaxed enough to chew on her kong toy!
