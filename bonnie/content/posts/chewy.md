We quickly learned that dogs have their own Amazon. It's called chewy.com and you can get damn near anything a dog (or dog owner) could want sent right to your front door. When we discovered the crate we bought at PetSmart wasn't quite tall enough, we got a replacement on chewy. Our friends Brian and Carrie (and Keva) sent presents to welcome Bonnie, including her mysteriously beloved cow. The cow moves in and out of Bonnie's bed. I've seen her kick it out when she's trying to dig the bottom of the bed into a comfortable state and I've seen her grab it by the leg and pull it in. I can't quite tell what she thinks about it, though.

I couldn't resist one of the Black Friday sale items on chewy's site: a Wisdom Panel DNA kit that promises to tell me all the breeds that make up Bonnie's ancestry. NHA guessed that she was a shepherd-lab mix, but since she's considred to be full grown at 31 pounds I'm guessing there's more to that story.
