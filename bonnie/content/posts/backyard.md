One place where Bonnie finds regular stimulation is our backyard. Because she is heartworm positive, she has to stay on leash while she explores and does her business. We live in a noisy neighborhood. Helicopters, children, trucks, and other random sounds have been regular sources of distress as Bonnie slowly gets to know her new home. She sniffs the ground tracking different things and sometimes gets a little excited about it. Her second freak out was abut something she sensed outside one evening and again the next morning. Looking around, I spotted this guy trying to hide in a tree.
