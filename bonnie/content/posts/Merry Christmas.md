Bonnie has been with us a month now. The time has really flown by. We like her, and she seems to like us pretty well, too. She's still skittish - alternately fearful and protective - but we've come to a pretty agreeable routine with relative ease. She wants to please us and comes when we call her. She goes to her crate at night with ease. She's affectionate and usually pretty chill.

Our friends Taylor and Sara dropped Bonnie's first Christmas present off at our doorstep today. They are pajamas for her, and I think she likes them!
